Any game art asset file(charactor, animation, map, icon, etc..) **does not** need to follow the GPLv2 license and belongs to the arthor who created them, all rights reserved.

**But** if the asset file will cause the game not running successfully or not fully functional after install, then asset files **must** be included.

#### If the project try to load a sprite sheet json file which associate with art assets, then the json file and art assets must be included. If there is in conflict with copyright,  at least you need to find some replacement. For example, a charactor animation does not need to be included with art file because even a transparent picture could make all the game logic continue working.
