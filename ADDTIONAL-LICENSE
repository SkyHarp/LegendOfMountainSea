ADDTIONAL_LICENSE
Tyreal Gray 2017.6.28

Any game art asset file(charactor, animation, map, icon, etc..) do not need to follow the GPLv2 license and belong to the arthor who created them, all rights reserved.

But if the asset file will cause the game not running successfully or not fully functional after install, then this asset file must be included.

For example, a charactor animation does not need to be included with source file because even a transparent picture could make all the game logic continue working.

But if the project try to load a sprite sheet json file which associate with assets, then the json file must be included and some kind of replacement asset file must be uploaded too.

Otherwise the code will not run correctly.
